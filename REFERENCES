How I/O works: volumes mounted

task-specific folder is created within the node-defined tasks-dir

Node: listen for new events
	When new event:

Creating files

The algorithm wrapper stores the file:

# FIXME: We should have a separate mount/volume for this. At the
        #   moment this is a potential leak as containers might access input,
        #   output and token from other containers.
        #
        #   This was not possible yet as mounting volumes from containers
        #   is terrible when working from windows (as you have to convert
        #   from windows to unix several times...).

        # If we're running in docker __tasks_dir will point to a location on
        # the data volume.
        # Alternatively, if we're not running in docker it should point to the
        # folder on the host that can act like a data volume. In both cases,
        # we can just copy the required files to it
