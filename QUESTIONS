According to the documentation:

The temporary directory can be used by an algorithm container to share files with other algorithm containers that:
- run on the same node
- have the same run_id
Algorithm containers that origin from another container (a.k.a master container or parent container) share the same run_id. i.o. if a user creates a task a new run_id is assigned.


- How the parent_id designation work?

- In which cases two containers have the same id?

- Why not use 'run_id' for the shared temporal volume?
